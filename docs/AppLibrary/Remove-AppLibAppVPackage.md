# Remove-AppLibAppVPackage

   Removes an App-V package from the library that is holding it

## Syntax
```
Remove-AppLibAppVPackage [-Uid] <Int32> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Provides the ability to remove an App-V package from the library that is holding it.

Removing a package from a library does not remove the whole reference to the package from the library, but rather marks it as not existing. Re-adding the package later will restore the reference. This cmdlet should only be used for removing packages from the manual library.

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
