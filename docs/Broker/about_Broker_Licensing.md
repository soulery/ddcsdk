    Citrix Broker - Licensing 

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Overview of broker licensing configuration. 

## LONG DESCRIPTION
    As part of the licensing setup for a site, the types of product licenses 
    used by the broker when creating connections to virtual desktops or 
    applications can be configured using the Central Configuration Service SDK. 

    The following licensing related properties can be specified using the 
    Set-ConfigSite cmdlet: 

    o   LicensingModel  - Sets the licensing model to use. Values can be 
        'Concurrent' or 'UserDevice'. 
    o   ProductCode - Specifies which product license is supported by the 
        site. Values can be ‘MPS’ for XenApp licenses or ‘XDT’ for XenDesktop 
        licenses. 
    o   ProductEdition - Sets the licensing edition to use. 

    A license matching the specified model, product code, and edition must be 
    available within the site's license server in order for the broker to grant 
    licenses. 

    These properties are part of the site object returned by the Get-ConfigSite 
    cmdlet. 

## CONCURRENT LICENSE MODEL
    A concurrent license is tied to a XenDesktop session. When a user launches a 
    session, a license is checked out to that session. When a user logs off 
    from a session, the license is checked back in again, making it available 
    for another session. 

## USER DEVICE LICENSE MODEL
    With user device licensing, the license server automatically assigns 
    licenses to users or devices based on usage: 

    o   User licensing allows users to access their desktops and applications 
        from multiple devices. 
    o   Device licensing allows multiple users to access their desktops and 
        applications from a single device. 

    When users or devices connect to an application or desktop, they consume a 
    license for a 90-day license assignment period. The assignment period begins 
    when a connection is made, is renewed to the full 90 days during the life of 
    the connection, and expires (allowing reassignment) 90 days after the last 
    connection terminates. A license assignment can be manually ended before the 
    90-day period elapses using the udadmin command line installed on the 
    license server. 

## LICENSING STATE
    The broker site contains the following properties related to licensing 
    state: 

    o   LicensingGracePeriodActive - Reports if the broker is in licensing 
        grace period. 
    o   LicensingOutOfBoxGracePeriodActive - Reports if the broker is in 
        out-of-box grace period. 
    o   LicensingGraceHoursLeft - The number of grace hours remaining, if the 
        broker is in grace period, else it is null. 
    o   LicensedSessionsActive - The number of active, licensed sessions. 
    o   LicenseGraceSessionsRemaining - The number of grace sessions available, 
        if the broker is in licensing grace period, else it is null. 

    These properties are part of the site object returned by the Get-BrokerSite 
    cmdlet. 

## LICENSE SERVER TEST
    The broker SDK cmdlet Test-BrokerLicenseServer checks whether or not a given 
    server can be used as a license server by the broker. 

## RESETTING LICENSE SERVER CONNECTION
    The broker SDK cmdlet Reset-BrokerLicensingConnection resets the broker's 
    connection to the license server. 

## LICENSE BURN-IN DATE
    The version of the product that is supported within the site is denoted by a 
    licensing burn-in date. This date can be accessed through the 
    LicensingBurnInDate field of the site object returned by the Get-ConfigSite 
    cmdlet.
