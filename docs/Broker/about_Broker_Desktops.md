## SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes desktop concepts and usage. 

## LONG DESCRIPTION
    A desktop is a machine that is able to run a Microsoft Windows desktop 
    environment (with a shell, icons and taskbar) or individual applications 
    (seamlessly integrated with the local desktop). The configuration of the 
    desktop determines whether it can run only desktop environments, only 
    applications, or both desktops and applications. Machines running 
    workstation operating systems are able to run one session at a time 
    (single-session), whereas machines running server operating systems have 
    the ability to run multiple simultaneous sessions (multi-session). 

    A key aspect of desktops is how they are assigned (or allocated) to users. 
    Two allocation types are supported: 

    o   Random/Shared - A user is assigned a desktop at random from a pool of 
        shared desktops. Multi-session desktops are able to run sessions to 
        multiple users simultaneously, whereas single-session desktops can only 
        run one session at a time, and are returned to the pool when the user 
        logs off. Single-session shared desktops usually discard user data 
        stored on them after the user logs off. Multi-session shared desktops, 
        however, do not tend to discard user data after a log-off, as this is 
        only possible when the desktop is rebooted by a reboot schedule. 

    o   Permanent/Private - A private desktop is permanently assigned to a 
        specific user and data stored on it is retained across logons and 
        restarts. A private desktop can have users assigned explicitly or on 
        first use. 

  DESKTOP GROUPS 
    Desktops are collected together in desktop groups, and these provide 
    a flexible grouping mechanism that can be used to associate: 

    o   Desktops running on a particular type of machine 
    o   Desktops with particular software installed 
    o   Desktops for a set of users 
    o   Desktops accessed in a similar way 
    o   Desktops configured in a particular way 
    o   Any combination of the above 

    Each desktop group can only contain one type of desktop, determined by its 
    AllocationType and SessionSupport properties. 

    When assigning shared desktops or assign-on-first-use (AOFU) desktops to 
    users, the set of candidates comes from available desktops in a particular 
    desktop group. 

    You configure power management policy for single-session desktop groups, 
    including peak and off-peak settings, for each desktop group. See 
    about_Broker_PowerManagement for details. 

  CREATION OF DESKTOPS 
    Desktop objects are created automatically when a machine is added to a 
    desktop group. The type of desktop is determined by the AllocationType 
    property of the desktop group. 

    In order for a machine to be added from a catalog, the machine must be 
    compatible with the desktop group. For this to be true, the catalog's 
    AllocationType must be compatible, and the SessionSupport property must 
    match. 

    Note: Because the session support and functional level of the machine are 
    determined by the software on the machine (operating system and Citrix VDA, 
    respectively), the SessionSupport and MinimalFunctionalLevel of the catalog 
    and desktop group may match, but not be compatible with the machine. In this 
    case any attempt of registration by the machine will fail. 

    You can add machines explicitly using the Add-BrokerMachine cmdlet, or a 
    number of free machines can be acquired from a catalog using the 
    Add-BrokerMachinesToDesktopGroup cmdlet. A machine can only be associated 
    with one desktop group at a time, and has a DesktopUid property that 
    references the corresponding desktop object. You can also associate desktops 
    to machines with their SID properties. 

    Desktop objects are deleted when the machine is removed from the desktop 
    group (using the Remove-BrokerMachine cmdlet). Desktops are also deleted 
    when the desktop group containing them is deleted (using the 
    Remove-BrokerDesktopGroup cmdlet). A desktop cannot be removed from a 
    catalog while it is in a desktop group. 

  SHARED (RANDOM) DESKTOPS 
    Shared desktops are published to users using entitlement policy rules. Each 
    entitlement rule allows access to a single session on a desktop machine, 
    selected at random from the available desktops in a desktop group (with a 
    preference for desktops that are powered on). If there are no available 
    desktops, launching the session fails. See about_Broker_EntitlementPolicy 
    and about_Broker_PowerManagement for details. 

  PRIVATE (STATIC) DESKTOPS 
    You can assign private desktops to users explicitly or automatically, with 
    the AOFU feature. It is also possible to assign private desktops to 
    particular clients (through IP or client name). 

    You explicitly assign machines or desktops to users with the Add-BrokerUser 
    cmdlet. Machines can be assigned to users before the machine has been added 
    to the desktop group (desktop created), but otherwise the effect is the 
    same. 

    With Add-BrokerUser you can assign a desktop to multiple users or user 
    groups. If the desktop has single-session support then the desktop will be 
    visible to multiple users, but only one user can log on to the desktop at 
    any time. 

    Assignment policy rules allow you to use AOFU to assign desktops to users in 
    a desktop group. When a user specified in an assignment policy rule launches 
    a session, and if the user does not already have an assigned desktop, the 
    broker selects an available desktop at random from the desktop group and 
    permanently assigns it to that user. Once assigned in this way, the desktop 
    behaves as though the assignment was made explicitly by an administrator. 
    See about_Broker_AssignmentPolicy for details. 

    It is possible to assign more than one desktop to a user. You can achieve 
    this by explicit assignment, multiple assignment policy rules, or the 
    MaxDesktops property of an assignment policy rule. 

## DESKTOP CONFIGURATION
    When presented to the user, desktops are identified by: 
    o   An icon (IconUid property) 
    o   A name (PublishedName property) 
    o   A description (Description property) 

    When starting the session, you can configure two connection settings: 
    o   The color depth used at the start of the session (ColorDepth property) 
    o   Whether SecureICA encryption is required (SecureIcaRequired property) 

    Each desktop group provides default values for these settings, but you can 
    override them if the desktop has more specific settings (PrivateDesktop), or 
    use an entitlement policy rule with more specific settings (SharedDesktop). 

    AOFU desktops can inherit these settings from the assignment policy rule 
    when the assignment to the user takes place. 

  MAINTENANCE MODE 
    There are times when it is necessary to disable desktops. You can do this 
    by setting the InMaintenanceMode property of a desktop to $true. This puts 
    it into maintenance mode. The broker excludes single-session desktops in 
    maintenance mode from brokering decisions and does not start new sessions on 
    them. Existing sessions are unaffected. For multi-session desktops in 
    maintenance mode, reconnections to existing sessions are allowed, but no new 
    sessions are created on the machine. 

    Desktops in maintenance mode are also excluded from automatic power 
    management, although explicit power actions are still performed. 

    Note that disabling desktop groups, entitlement policy rules, assignment 
    policy rules, or applications are other ways of disabling aspects of 
    brokering. 

## DESKTOP STATUS
    Once desktops are created, you can query the configuration and state 
    information for different kinds of desktop, or retrieve more information 
    about desktops using the Get-BrokerMachine cmdlet. To get details of any 
    sessions running on the desktops, use the Get-BrokerSession cmdlet. 

    You can also group desktops by a specific property, counting the number of 
    desktops with each value using the Group-BrokerMachine cmdlet. This can 
    provide useful summary statistics. 

## DESKTOP USAGE
    Every hour the broker records how many desktops from each desktop group 
    are in use, and the Get-BrokerDesktopUsage cmdlet returns this information. 
    Analyze historical usage records to understand desktop usage patterns and 
    help with the choice of idle pool and buffer settings. 

## DESKTOP CONDITIONS
    CPU usage, ICA latency, and profile logon times of desktops are monitored. 
    When one of these values exceeds a threshold (configured by policy), the 
    condition is flagged in the DesktopConditions property of the desktop. When 
    the value drops below the threshold again, the condition is cleared. Use 
    Get-BrokerMachine or Group-BrokerMachines cmdlets to query this information.
